# mini-shell
This is a mini shell I built for compute systems course. It is a command line interpreter that behaves like the linux shell. Have features like cd, history, exit, help, ls, pwd, and many more. <br>
To run the program you first need to complie 'clang mini-shell.c -o shell', after that run the executable './shell'. And after that enjoy the mini shell project that I built!
